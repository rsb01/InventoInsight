# InventoInsight: Kirana Store Data Analysis & Optimization

Here, I went to a Local Kirana Store and collected their data on Profits , loss , Sales, Inventory , Purchase and made some meaningful insights for it.

After gathering the raw data, I used excel to preprocess the data. Although we can use pandas for it, I used only excel because my professor demanded it.

Then using the preprocessed data, I concluded which variables which are important for the business.
